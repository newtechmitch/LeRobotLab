# LeRobotLab

Personal exploration and experimentation with LeRobot datasets and models.

## Project Overview

This repository contains experiments and analysis tools for working with LeRobot datasets from the HuggingFace Hub, with a focus on SO100 and SO101 robot datasets.

### Quick Setup for Dataset Exploration

For just exploring datasets (this project's focus), you can use a minimal setup d

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n lerobotlab python=3.10
conda activate lerobotlab

# Install dependencies
conda install jupyter pandas requests tqdm ipywidgets -c conda-forge
pip install huggingface_hub
```


The project folder should be next to a LeRobot install. 
For the  LeRobot installation, follow the official installation guide:
[LeRobot Installation Instructions](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot#installation)

## Contents

### SO100-SO101 Exploration Notebook

- **`so100_so101_exploration.ipynb`**: Comprehensive search and analysis of SO100/SO101 robot datasets
  - Searches HuggingFace Hub for relevant datasets
  - Extracts metadata, licensing, and size information
  - Generates clean CSV output for analysis
  - Handles datasets with proper size estimation and error handling
-> *Generated* Data **`so100_so101_datasets_analysis.csv`**: Clean dataset analysis output (generated by running the notebook)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab so100_so101_exploration.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells to perform the dataset search and generate the CSV analysis

3. Review the generated CSV file for dataset insights


### LeRobot Dataset Exploration Notebook

- **`LeRobot_dataset_exploration.ipynb`**: Comprehensive exploration of all HuggingFace datasets authored by "lerobot"
  - Discovers and processes metadata from all datasets under the `lerobot/` namespace on HuggingFace Hub
  - Covers a wide variety of robot hardware: ALOHA, Franka, UR5, Sawyer, Stretch, and many more
  - Extracts detailed information: episodes, samples, FPS, robot types, camera configurations
  - Downloads sample videos from datasets with camera data for local preview
  - Generates interactive HTML visualization with embedded video players
  - Creates organized folder structure for offline browsing
  - Provides parallel processing for efficient dataset handling
  - **Generated Output**: 
    - `lerobot_datasets_videos.html`: Interactive web interface for dataset exploration
    - `videos/`: Local video samples organized by dataset and camera
